# Light and Dark Mode

In recent years, the concept of light and dark mode has gained significant traction in user interface design. Offering users the choice between light and dark color schemes has become a standard feature in many applications and websites. This adaptation addresses the diverse preferences and needs of users while also enhancing overall usability and accessibility.

To enhance user experience, localStorage is utilized to store and remember the user's preference for light or dark mode. This means that once a user selects their preferred mode, their choice is saved locally within their browser, ensuring that the interface consistently reflects their desired setting across sessions.
